# About

I tried [Modalys for Max](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/modalys/). I made a polyphonic synthesizer that uses four `mlys.mono-strings` to make one sound. I combined this synth with reverb to make a synth pad sound. Note: You need [Modalys for Max](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/modalys/) to run this patch. Also, the patch has high CPU usage.
